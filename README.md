# Machine Learning Guides

_These are resources that I am gathering for personal reference so that
I can formulate a solid learning plan for myself._

## Current Learning Plan

_Resources I am currently focusing on, taken from below_

* Udacity's [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)

* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn//printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) - Chapters 1-4, 7-8

## Mostly Free Resources that Look Promising

* [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) - free

* [Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - $50/month

* [Stanford's Machine Learning Videos / Coursera from Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9qNFMHZ-A4rycgrgOYma6zxF4BZGGPW) - free - unclear if this is the same as above

* [Practical Deep Learning For Coders by Jeremy Howard](http://course.fast.ai/) - looks free

* [A Super Harsh Guide to Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5z8110/d_a_super_harsh_guide_to_machine_learning/) - a reddit post w/ good resources

* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn//printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) - free - a supposedly essential textbook (chapters 1-4 & 7-8 are recommended)

* [Stanford's CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/) - looks free

* [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) - The leading textbook in AI, many resources on this site

* [ML Courses](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-machine-learning-ml) - resource of resources

* [Harvard's CS109 Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) - looks free

* [Elite Data Science](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning) - free resource of resources

## Udacity Nanodegree Courses - Free

_Copied from [mikesprague](https://github.com/mikesprague/udacity-nanodegrees)_

_Nanodegrees from Udacity are around $1,000 -- These are the courses that make up two of their ML nanodegrees. It looks to me as if these were the courses for these specific nanodegrees at a certain point in time, it is likely that they have updated the nanodegrees to offer different courses now. That being said, this appears to be a very solid learning path._
